# Tailwind CSS Content Paths Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components, usually due to incorrectly configured content paths in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

The main problem lies in how Tailwind CSS searches for your files that utilize its utility classes. If the paths in the `content` array within the `tailwind.config.js` are incorrect or incomplete, Tailwind won't scan them, and hence, won't apply the corresponding styles.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly specifying the paths within the `content` array of your Tailwind configuration file to include all files that use Tailwind classes. This allows Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler to accurately find and include the necessary styles.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application (instructions might vary depending on the project setup).
4. Observe that some styles might not be applied correctly.

## How to Fix

1. Correct the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` to accurately represent the paths to your component files. 
2. Ensure your Tailwind setup (including the installation and configuration) is correct.
3. Run the Tailwind build process.
